Here are listed my general thoughts on work I have done in my life. There is also some useful stuff here I promise!

## Ocean Modelling Research @ Georgia Tech | LANL
[Presentation](./Lagrangian_presentation.ppt) and [Report](./lagrangian_report.pdf) on the effect of model resolution, seasonality on lagrangian trajectories launched in a South Atlantic ocean model.

[Presentation](./GOM15_Keshav.ppt) at Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill & Ecosystem Science Conference on the effects of spatial resolution of the ocean model on tracer evolution and dynamics

[Paper](./bracco2016.pdf) on submesoscale phenomena observed in the same ocean models at higher resolution

## Lecturing @ University of Guyana
[Talk](./Joshi_TechEdTalk_UG.ppt) on ML/AI and its many uses in the modern world, basic introduction, and how AI is not an existential threat

## OMSCS @ Georgia Tech

### CS 6300: Software Development Process
- I learnt how to:
	- do unit testing
	- about different design patterns
	- that there is no silver bullet
	- that Android Studio is a hassle
### CS 6601: Artificial Intelligence
minimax | markov chain modeling | game theory | rational agent
### CS 7641: Machine Learning
- theoretical ML
	- hypothesis space
- power of random forests
- ICA vs PCA
	- orthogonal components vs. components that explain variance
### CS 7642: Reinforcement Learning
- RL theory | rational agent
- simplicity of bellman eqns.
- game theory
### CS 8803: Graduate Algorithms
### CS 7646: Machine Learning for Trading
### [CS 6460: Educational Technology](http://omscs6460.gatech.edu/)
- [Physics-js](https://github.com/kmjoshi/physics-js): interactive website to teach physics (under construction)
- Exposure to:
	- the field of EdTech
	- the great work being done by other students and practitioners
	- as well as very cool ideas like constructionism that are behind products like Scratch
### CS 6035: Intro to Information Security
- web hacks are cool: XSS | XSRF | SQL injection
	- PHP is bad?!
- stack overflow!
### CS 6250: Computer Networks
- Can computer networking theory/protocols be applied to social networks? Are they?
- TCP vs. UDP
### [CSE 6242: Data and Visual Analytics](https://poloclub.github.io/cse6242-2018fall-online/)

- [Google Trends Symptom Clusters](http://35.239.193.75/): Visualising clusters of medical symptoms searched in Google over time and at state-level, alongside their pair-correlations as a network/graph 
- Exposure to: AWS | Hadoop | Spark | Scala etc.
- Azure ML studio is a great GUI for ML pipelines
